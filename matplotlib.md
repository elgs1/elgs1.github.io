## Earthquakes

**Project description:** Visualisations of Earthquake data, does location effect magnitude?

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Stronger and more earthquakes on tectonic plate lines

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

Yes there is, do more
